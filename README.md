## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I loved to be back at coding after a while, I think it was a easy challeng but for sure I can improve myself also in this easy code.
I need to keep practice.  


### Continued development

I will continue with Frontend Mentor challenges for improving myself and I will try, in the next challenges, to add some technologies such as Bootstrap, Sass and Tailwind.
